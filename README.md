# My name is Ricardo. I'm really new to GitHub. I've been in the system for about 2 years, but I recently started using it.
# I have about 6 years of experience as a pen tester and ethical hacker. Before, I practiced it for fun, today I am studying at the University of Salem in the state of West.

# Virginia and obviously I study in several academies in order to achieve my goals of getting certified in various areas of work and I do not specialize in just one subject because it would be very Difficult to understand the complete system of Software and Hardware. 
# I have to thank many people who have contributed so that I can go far and achieve my goals. 
# For the advice I receive from David Bombal's vchannel and Ne0tworkChuk among others. I also have to thank all the teachers at Uacademy HTB and ITpro.tv.
# They are the best for CompTIAA+ and CCNA CCNP they have the best courses easy to understand and fast so you can take the exam and win many battles against the Black Cap .
# Also subcribes to their chanels it could be the best choise you can make to end 2022 and start 2023.
